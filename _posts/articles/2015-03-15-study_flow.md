The idea behind Bible Study With Me is based on 2 or more people studying together.  Powered by the social media concept, we developed a safe place where people can study together. The study flow has always been a concern and such a concern that we have spent hours on one particular detail…the next button.  We have toiled over this button from how it should look, where to place it and the big question, “what will it do”.  We realized the thing that made sense to us, as developers, did not necessarily make sense to the user.  Along with many other enhancements on BSWM, we have improved the “Next Button”.  As before, we could move to the next question once the “Next Button” was enabled.  Now, we are able to tab or swipe through the entire lesson.  The study flow is maintained by allowing the app to remember the current question; automatically sliding the comment box into view.  

This video is a demonstration of how I can move from beginning to the end of the lesson without ever entering a comment.  Also, this demonstrates the comment box sliding in and out of view.  The comment box will only slide into view on the current or following question.
