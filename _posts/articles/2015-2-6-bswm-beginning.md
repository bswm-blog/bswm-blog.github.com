Bible study is the study of God. If you want to know the genuine in order to discern the counterfeit, study the Bible. The Bible testifies of God ([John 5:39](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=john+5%3A39&version=NKJV)).

####Motivation

BibleStudyWithMe started with the premise that there is value in studying the Bible with other people. I can learn more about God by hearing how He speaks to other people than by just studying alone. We are the sum of our experiences, and your experiences are different than mine, so you may have a different perspective from which to view parts of scripture than I do. As we apply what we learn, I expect we will be changed. Love will grow in our hearts and we will see others in the same light that God sees them. Jesus told the disciples to go make disciples([Matthew 28:19-20](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+28%3A19-20&version=NKJV)). If I am not making disciples, am I really a disciple? I *want* to be a disciple.

So, with the desire to study the Bible with others and make disciples, we began our work. There were many things we got right, things that were not exactly right, and still others that were wrong. We adapted as we gained knowledge as to how people use the applcation and made improvements. God has been leading all the way.

####End of Version 1

While working on the next version of BibleStudyWithMe, a new version built from the ground up, we experienced a server outage that affected the current release. After a couple of days trying to resolve the issues we realized that there was much more work to do. We made the difficult decision to temporarily shut down BibleStudyWithMe until the new version is ready. I am blessed by the response from the community - so many heart felt thanks and encouragement to continue our work. 

The mission of BibleStudyWithMe is, and always will be, to provide a place where people can go to learn more of God and to help others do the same. As of this writing the new version is weeks away. We will use this blog to keep you updated as to our progress and describe the new features.
