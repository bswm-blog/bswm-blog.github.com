*I have become all things to all men, that I might by all means save some.*  ([1 Corinthians 9:22](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+9%3A19-23))

Paul inspires me to go out of my way to meet people where they are. I understand that BibleStudyWithMe will not resonate with everyone but we thought that the potential of connecting with people from around the globe for the purpose of discussing heavenly things would appeal to many. 

Recently we had a negative rating in the Google Play store:

>Sign In? Really I uninstalled this immediately because I don't believe I should have to sign into a facebook or google account to use an app. It's bad enough so many of these apps want so much information to even use their app. Ridiculous!

Two days later we received this rating:

>Registration No,  I don't like when I need to hand over details via Google or Facebook. Love myjesus. I hoped this would be of similar caliber but it's not

I want to be clear about what happens when you log in to BibleStudyWithMe and why we chose to do it this way.

There was a time, some years back, when most websites required you to register with a user account. For me, this was problematic because I needed to remember a username and password for all of the sites that I frequented. Worse, if I used the same username and password for every site then my privacy and personal data would be at risk if my credentials were stolen from any one of the sites. A group of really smart people designed a process called Single Sign On or Open Authentication. This allows you to have an account with a company that you trust to keep this information secure and use this to log in to other sites. BibleStudyWithMe does not manage usernames and passwords. We trust Google and Facebook to this. 

Here's how it works. When you log in to BibleStudyWithMe by selecting Google, your request is sent to Google, which will prompt you to provide your username and password. Understand that this is not BibleStudyWithMe collecting your credentials - you are seeing the Google login page in a web browser. Once you successfully log in, Google sends back a response telling us who you are. There are many more technical details that I'm leaving out but know that this is a very secure standard. It works the same way if you were to select Facebook. You are not providing any information to Google or Facebook than what they already have.

After reading the bad reviews we spent some time reviewing how we might change things to remove user authentication. While this is possible, it will degrade some of the features that we believe make BibleStudyWithMe a great platform for Bible study. Also, we feel that we have an obligation to the community to ensure that BibleStudyWithMe is a safe and pleasant place to spend time. We have experienced that people will sometimes behave badly when they are anonymous. You can see this in blog post comments, twitter, etc. This is such a huge problem that Twitter has started a program to battle hate speech. If requiring users to log in will discourage bad behavior then it's worth it. I understand that we may be turning some away because of this and that makes me sad but finding out that someone is being harrassed on BibleStudyWithMe would make me even more sad.

While I would like to be all things to all people like Paul, BibleStudyWithMe will not be. The good news is that we also have MyJesus that doesn't require user authentication. Michael and I have poured ourselves into these projects since 2012. We have families and jobs but we do this work because of our dedication to Christ and our heavenly Father. We aren't making any money from this nor do we plan to. All of this is offered free to the public. Currently we are working on an iOS app and have more plans after this. 

If you like what we are doing, please rate the application and let your friends know. If there is a problem or you would like to have a new feature or some improvement, please let us know. As for those that don't like BibleStudyWithMe, we will try to build something that appeals to their interests in the future.

Blessings,\\
Doug
